This is my project repositrory for MDD 0114 at Full Sail Online

About the application:
	This app will replace you standard calender with a progress bar for the year you will be able to set up important dates similar to a date book.I will be using foundation, angular.js, firebase, and firebase's facebook api for login. My hope is to build a new way fun way to read the date and keep track of important events.
