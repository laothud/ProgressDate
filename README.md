This is my project repositrory for MDD 0114 at Full Sail Online

About the application:
	This app will replace you standard calender with a progress bar for the year you will be able to set up important dates similar to a date book.I will be using foundation, angular.js, firebase, and firebase's facebook api for login. My hope is to build a new way fun way to read the date and keep track of important events.

	By increasing the size of the Featured CTA this will fall in line with the rest of the proportions and look much better.
